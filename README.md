## More
I currently live just outside of Toronto, with my Wife and Dog(Cloud) I enjoy playing all types of games but mostly love creating new things.

I may not have the most orthodox methods for coding but hey, if it works, it works :) I strive to learn as much as I can as well as teach as much as I can at the same time, the biggest way you can help me and my work, is to pay it forward take something you've learned from me or my work and help others learn as well :)
